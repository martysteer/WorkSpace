Today I'm going to discuss briefly the

Mental and physical maintenance during gameplay.

Thematics:

We dream – we consume AV entertainment – we dream again. As CGI informs the dreamscape, Interactivity (lucidity) increases in the dream – the immersion is more convincing. Current Playspace is very contemporary concept, especially play that permits the perceived access to morally/ethically suspect activity.

The space between perceived realities and real realities is compressing – what is more filmic (or gamic) than skyscrapers tumbling like matchwood, or killer tsunamis ravaging 2 continents

So, if reality takes on the hue of a purchased dream, how then are our dreams constructed using the tools of the software developer, the CAD modeller and the Hollywood budget. And if then we see convergence between the game and the film and the book and the experience of all three – where will we end up? Convergence theory and interaction space – The morality of play (and playing with morality) – The exclusion of the social in the “play”ground

Physical self-maintenance in an online world.

BEGIN (FIGHT!):

I peer over the parapet of the gritty sandstone wall down to the square below, the sky is very close above – I reach up and touch a cloud, there is terrible burning sound and they appear…faceless, clashing mandibles – I see my legs go, bloodless and painless but with an awful subdued grief of loss. With terrible slowness I swing my weapon around to bear and they open up like swatted leeches, each glottal explosion accompanied by a circumferential shockwave, the guns recoil driving the chequered grips deep into my palms, I can see the LEDs of the ammo select panel partially obscured by my bloodied knuckles. The sky whites out with an unknown detonation, I wake to the cat hassling me for Whiskas…
