It’s late, you’re bored, there’s nothing on telly: Not true, you’re just not trying hard enough…

You’ve had a hard day, you wanna chill out, but lets face it you can’t always maintain your stringent tenets of cultural observance. You peruse your DVDs: Cohen Bros, Lasse Hallstrom, Wim Wenders, no good…You look at your bookshelf: Neal Stephenson, Chuck Palahniuk, Douglas Coupland – screw those guys. Even Gandolfini isn’t going to cut it tonight – you need some serious schlock.

Who can help? Grab the cable remote, the high 120s is your destination (a stolen crown from ITV)… you need TV movie hell (TMH). Doesn’t matter that it’s started (even though the mid-80s credits font will help you pin it down), 10 seconds and you're in. Score points for suburban paranoia inducers (a sleazy sports coach helps), score double for William Shatner in a truss. Like a Fray Bentos pie, a Tom Clancy novel; TMH sooths like no other, 90 minutes of lurid anxiety on a shoestring. Fuck it, it’s a school night.
