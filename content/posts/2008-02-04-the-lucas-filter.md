**The Lucas Filter** is very useful tool for handling the banalities and frankly distressing high frequency of boredom interludes that modern life throws up. Basically, using a familiar and easy to remember set of Star Wars memes practically any situation can be rendered tolerable and/or fleetingly amusing. For example: Stuck in a dead end telesales job flogging marginal products in a saturated market? Use the **Sabre Meme**: Mentally substitute your normal, deeply average product for a notional light sabre competitive product. A typical cold call might go as follows:

***"Hello, is that the Jedi Council?"***

***Yes, how may I direct your call?***

***"Please may I speak with you main Jedi equipment decision maker?***

***"That will be Mace Windu, putting you through..."***

***click...whrrr...chirp***

***"This is Windu"***

***"Hello Jedi Windu, my name is Droga Jax, I'm calling from a company called LightCosh, we sell a high qualiy range of combat armament for the discerning Jedi. May I ask what type of primary weapon you use?"***

***"A light sabre \*sigh\*"***

***"Oh really, how has that ownership been for you, Jedi sir?"***

***"Fine. Will this take long? I have a council meeting in 20 minutes"***

***"Of course, I appreciate you are a busy man, I just wanted to introduce you our flagship jedi weapon offering, the LightCosh. this innovative anti-personnel weapon is proven to deflect 4% more blaster rounds than a conventional light sabre, and is offered with a 2 year guarantee with a 50% refund in the event of your death or untimely carbon freezing."***

***"Of, for fuc..."***

*Click, brrrr....*

So you can see how the most mundane of interactions can be rendered a little more tolerable with the application of this useful device. Other applications of this filter could include: **The Jabba Palace Meme**: I imagine that much like millions of other employees you are beset at all sides by a legion of fucking morons, either your direct colleagues or some sort of terrible shower of line managers and the like. If, on a rainy Wednesday, follow a hollow and life crushing annual performance review simply perform a find and replace routine on your colleagues appearances using denizens from jabba's palace as replacement templates.

**Derek from accounts?**\
Fuck you Bantha fodder, just step a little to the right please..?

**Policy adherence officer blues?**\
Eat this thermal detonator Sarah, your interminable accounts of your boring weekends on your moisture farm make me want to die.

**Is the MD visiting this week?**\
Imagine the chain digging incrementally into her flabby neck as your metal gusset abrades uncomfortably against your groin.

**Stuttering, no-mark from IT wont fix your PC?**\
You're basically C3PO without the marginal cachet of a gay following; come the rebel victory you'll be first up against the re-processing sheds.

And so it goes, infinite applications, endless gallows humour...
