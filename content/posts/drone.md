Rage is everywhere, and not be confused with the common everyday grit of irritation and inconvenience. Modern life is a rich breeding ground for all manner of near instantaneous ignitions of fury. This is a phenomena that warrants some examination, not least because this healthy state is increasingly proscribed by an ever growing muffler of involuntary social restraint. Whoa, nearly lost my shit then, sorry - what I want to focus on here briefly is a narrow band of specialised vehicular incurred wrath. To wit: The commute. _(Firstly though, a caveat, or proviso - I'm always right here - so what you might in the future confuse with arrogance or hubris is just me being right)._ The Commute:

*   **Drivers:** All cunts (apart from me).
*   **Commuters**: Temporally-specific cunts.
*   **Pocket Hitler lane-Nazis on off-ramp queues**: Cunts.
*   **Panel battered tail-gating car crocodiles in the outside lane woefully exchanging insurance details**: Uber-cunts.
*   **Gesticulating school run martinets in SUVs**: Oh my fucking God.
*   **Magpies**: Spooky.
*   **Fog-lights during the day**: Come the revolution...
*   **Commercial radio DJs:** Definitely all cunts.
*   **Having to work at the end of the commute**: Cuntish.

To conclude: I'm not a good morning person, and even if I was they'd still be all cunts.

*   **Carbon cultists:** Etiolated spawn of the devil.

Oops, that's next weeks...
