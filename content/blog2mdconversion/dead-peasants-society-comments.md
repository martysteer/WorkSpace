In high college quantifiable final results are valued over personal growth. I do not wish to sound like the lazy kid complaining, but I write essays that goes beyond the requirements, putting inside a great deal of work for the sake of knowledge's intrinsic value, though I am, for all-intents-and-purposes in the educational technique,? considered stupid since I am apathetic about the tedious "fill-in-the-blank" assignments. On the end on the day I am give the stigma "lazy". It is ignorance major to uniformity. My website: [stop premature ejaculation](http://moodle.thegraal.net/user/view.php?id=11255&course=1)
